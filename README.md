# How to setup locally on your computer
1. Download and extract the master github archive
2. For whichever web browser you are using (chromium or firefox), rename that file to manifest.json (ex. You are using firefox, rename firefox-manifest.json to manifest.json)
3. Locate main.js in /assets/main.js, then change browserType to the type of webbrowser that you are using "chrome" or "firefox"
4. You can now install the unpacked extension locally (If you don't know how, there are plenty of tutorials online)

* Please note that the actual Snake AI is not created by me, but by Code Bullet (https://thebigcb.com)
